Thesis Title - Masked Prediction on time series data using Transformer based models

Our thesis was to predict missing values of signals received from trucks' battery modules. The objective of this project is to create a model that performs a masked prediction of time series data. After the insights obtained from the literature review and EDA on the signals received from the trucks, it was decided to build a transformer-based model for predicting the significant features. The initial goal for the thesis project is to predict missing values for only one feature and obtain very high accuracy on that. The scope of the thesis in the future would involve modifying the model to predict all the significant features of the dataset. In addition, it will forecast the features, whose duration will be decided in the future.
